# Thread-queue-simulator
The project represents a program in which the user can simulate queues theough threading. Initially the user will have to write several inputs related to the simulation: number of
clients, number of queues, service time etc. If the inputs are correct, then the input window will close and the simulation will start. The evolution and result of the simulation will
be written in the "result.txt" text file. The scope of the project was to exemplify the use of Threading. The project was written entirely in Java.
